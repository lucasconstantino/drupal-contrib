My Drupal Contributions
=======================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/lucasconstantino/drupal-contrib.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Container repository I use to contribute Drupal modules and patches. The contributions that consist on new modules are added as Git submodules that point to the project's repository on Drupal. To understand how Git submodules work, please refer to the [documentation page](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## [Taxonomy Sort](https://drupal.org/sandbox/lucas.constantino/2122561)

A interface to create customized and automated taxonomy sorting methods.

## [Adaptative Panes](https://drupal.org/sandbox/lucas.constantino/2283837)

Panels has always had a bit of a problem when working with responsive designs. This module provides an interface to configure panes to be distributed in a grid for each available breakpoints in the site, much like Bootstrap grid works.

## [Breakpoints JS](https://drupal.org/sandbox/lucasconstantino/2270645)

This module means to create a JavaScript interface for other modules to make use of breakpoints in the client side using a common way. While enquire.js gives us the ability to easily define code that runs on specific media conditions, it implies we have to work with media-query strings. As Breakpoints module creates an interface to manage and name these media-queries, it makes sense that we use these names in our client-side code too. That is what this module provides.
